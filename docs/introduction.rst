Introduction
===============

The Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE) is a powerful toolkit that facilitates
various types of chemical simulations by providing an object-oriented interface 
to represent and manipulate groups of atoms. ASE’s flexibility has enabled numerous 
successful projects, particularly in areas like molecular dynamics and material science. 
However, when it comes to post-simulation analysis, particularly for analyzing diverse 
simulation trajectories, existing tools often fall short.

CRISP (**C**\ lustering, **R**\ adial, and other **I**\ nsightful **S**\ imulation **P**\ ost-processing) 
aims to fill this
gap by building upon ASE's robust foundation. CRISP offers a streamlined approach to post-simulation analysis, 
designed to handle the intricacies of a wide range of simulation trajectories—not just those from molecular dynamics. 
By leveraging an object-oriented programming approach, CRISP provides a suite of tools that:

- Overcome the limitations of existing post-simulation analysis tools by offering advanced clustering, radial distribution, and hydrogen bond analysis, with a focus on intuitive usability.
- Simplify complex analysis tasks such as atom indexing, coordination patterns, and mean square displacement, ensuring that even intricate details are easily accessible and interpretable.
- Maintain a seamless workflow from simulation to analysis, allowing researchers to extract meaningful insights without the need to juggle multiple tools or scripts.

CRISP’s ability to analyze any simulation trajectory, coupled with its powerful and customizable analysis 
features, makes it an useful tool for researchers looking to deepen their understanding of atomic and 
molecular behaviors in their simulations.
