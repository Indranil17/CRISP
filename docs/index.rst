Welcome to CRISP's documentation! (Under development)
=========================================================
CRISP is a post-simulation analysis package built on the 
foundation of Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE). 
It is designed to unlock the secrets hidden within your 
molecular simulations, offering a comprehensive 
suite of tools for in-depth exploration for both analysis and visulaisation.

The CRISP python code is developed through our GitLab repository:
